## Environment preparation
1. First use the 'GIT' client to checkout this repository. If you are not familiar with GIT, just download the repository [ZIP](https://github.com/macalak/stispringio/archive/master.zip) and unzip it on your disk.
2. You need the JDK distribution. Download the latest one and install it from the [Oracle site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)Do not forget to set '*JAVA_HOME*' environment variable pointing to JDK installation folder.
3. You can use any text editor to edit source code, but the Java IDE is better option. If you already do not have one, download and install the [STS](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) for instance.
4. Take the Tomcat AS distribution with integrated Derby database from this repository 'server/apache-tomcat-8.0.27.zip'. Unzip it into 'server/runtime' folder.

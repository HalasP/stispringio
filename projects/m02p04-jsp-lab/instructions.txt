Implementing the complete Web application using the Java Servlets it does not support the productivity and
separation of concerns. The Servlet mixes the presentation with business logic so change in any layer will
require modification of Servlet code. The developer needs to be expert in Web technologies as well as in 
Java server side programming. The JSP technology separates the web layer and business layer and it is build
on top of Java Servlet technology. You can also use the Java code directly in the JSP page, but this approach
can be eliminates by using the JSTL tags.
This Lab demonstrates simple Java web application with JSPs on presentation layer.

1. First, deploy the application and open the http://localhost:8080/m02p04-jsp-lab in web browser.
The HTML page containing the Users table should be rendered. Now open the users.jsp page and review it.
Notice that Java code is mixed with HTML code.

2. Your task is to implement the books.jsp page which will contain the list of books. You can use the existing LibraryService
implementation directly to retrieve list of Books.

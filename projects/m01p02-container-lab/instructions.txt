Now we are going to configure our Spring application using Java.
We still need application-context configuration file in order to instruct Spring to use annotations. 
There is ite.librarymaster.service.LibraryServiceImplTest JUnit test already implemented in src/test/java folder,
which can be used to verify the application initialization. 


1. Run the LibraryServiceImplTest JUnit test, and check the output. Test should fail.

2. There is ite.librarymaster.LibraryConfig class where we are going to implement
   Spring configuration. There is complete implementation of libraryService() method
   which acts as factory method for LibraryService bean.   
   Notice missing implementation of bookRepository() and userRepository() factory methods.
   Implementation should be very simple. Just create new instances of repositories.
   
3. Now we need to instruct Spring to take the LibraryConfig class as container configuration and
   its methods as Spring Beans factories. 
   We can use @Configuration and @Bean annotations to achieve this goal. So annotate class with @Configuration
   annotation and factory methods with @Bean annotation.         
   	
4. That it is. Check your result of your effort by running the ite.librarymaster.service.LibraryServiceImplTest JUnit test.
   Now, the test result should be green.	
   Notice @Annotations in JUnit test source file.
